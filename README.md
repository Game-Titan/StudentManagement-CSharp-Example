# C# Student Management System (Basic OOP Example)

This is a simple console application developed in C# to demonstrate fundamental Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. It allows for the creation and display of basic student information.

---

## ‚ú® Features

* **Student Class Definition:** Defines a `Student` class to model student entities.
* **Object Instantiation:** Creates multiple `Student` objects with different data.
* **Information Display:** Provides a method to neatly display each student's name, ID, and major to the console.

---

## üöÄ Concepts Demonstrated

This project showcases core C# and OOP principles, including:

* **Classes and Objects:** Understanding how to define a blueprint (`Student` class) and create instances (`student1`, `student2`).
* **Constructors:** Using a constructor to initialize object properties when an object is created.
* **Instance Variables (Fields):** Storing unique data for each object (`name`, `ID`, `major`).
* **Methods:** Defining behavior within a class (`DisplayStudentInfo`).
* **String Interpolation (`$`):** A convenient way to embed variables within strings for cleaner output.
* **Console Input/Output:** Basic interaction with the console to display information.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **C#**
* **.NET** (likely .NET Core or .NET 6+/7+)

---



## üí° Future Improvements (Optional Ideas)

* Add properties for age, grade, or address.
* Implement methods for updating student information.
* Add a list or array to store multiple student objects.
* Allow user input to create new student objects.
* Save and load student data to/from a file (e.g., CSV, JSON).
